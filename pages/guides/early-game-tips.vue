          1. Build a Barracks Early
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Every civilization has access to their Barracks in Age I. By making a
          Barracks early on, not only do you enable yourself to defend against
          early aggression from your opponent, but also to move out with your
          own troops and put pressure on your opponent instead.

          2. Consider Researching Loom
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Loom increases your Villagers&apos; survivability by a substantial
          amount, so if your opponent is being very aggressive with their units
          in Age I, consider researching this Upgrade early on so you have more
          time to react and escape with your Villagers. Better safe than sorry!

          3. Use your Scout
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Scouts are excellent at delaying your opponent&apos;s incoming Units.
          Keep a close eye to your opponent&apos;s Barracks and as soon as you
          see them sending Units towards your base, start attacking them with
          your Scout.

          4. Abandon your Hunt
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          If you are being overwhelmed by your opponent&apos;s Units, quickly
          move your Villagers away from your hunts and start gathering from the
          Berry Bushes next to your Town Center instead.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Even though Berries are slower than Hunts, it&apos;s better to gather
          from Berries safely than to lose your Villagers. Don&apos;t forget to
          research Picker&apos;s Gloves if you do so!
