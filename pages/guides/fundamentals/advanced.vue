          1. Use Hotkeys for Production
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Hotkeys allow you to perform actions much, much faster than you would
          otherwise be able to. By default, Unit Production Hotkeys are based on
          an ASDF layout on your keyboard. You can easily remember this layout
          and train Units by pressing the corresponding Hotkey for them, rather
          than clicking on their icons.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Another group of Hotkeys are "Find Unit Hotkeys" which allow you to
          quickly select a Unit and Building, regardless of where it is on the
          map. You can utilize this type of Hotkey in various situations such as
          when you want to find your Scout to do more Scouting, or perhaps when
          you want to select a Storehouse to quickly research an economy upgrade
          without looking for a Storehouse on the map and clicking on it.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          There are many different and useful Hotkeys in the Hotkeys section of
          the Options menu. Take your time and learn them. You won&apos;t regret
          it!

          2. Use Control Groups
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Control groups let you select Units or Buildings that curently
          aren&apos;t on your screen and learning them will turn you into a much
          better player.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          You can create a new control group by selecting a Unit or Building,
          holding Ctrl and then pressing a number key.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          For example, Ctrl + 1 would assign control group 1 to any Unit or
          Building you have selected and you can simply press 1 to highlight it,
          wherever it is.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          If you want to add new Units or Buildings to your Control group, you
          can select them and hold Shift + 1 to add them to your existing
          Control group 1.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Check the "Selection Group Hotkeys" section of the Hotkeys menu to
          find out more about Control Group Hotkeys.

          3. Watch your Minimap
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          The minimap is an excellent tool to keep an overview of what&apos;s
          going on in your match. You can see enemy Units moving towards your
          base and prepare your defenses accordingly, always being one step
          ahead of your opponent.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          You can also keep an eye on different Resources on the map, both for
          yourself and your opponent.
