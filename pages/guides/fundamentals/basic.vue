          1. Always Make Villagers
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Constantly train Villagers until you have 70-90 of them. The only time
          your Town Center should not be training Villagers is when you are
          aging up or researching something in it. If you follow this simple yet
          critically important rule, you will quickly see improved results in
          your matches.

          2. Avoid Idle Villagers
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Idle Villagers are nothing but a detriment to your economy. Constantly
          pay attention to the Idle Villager notification and make sure to
          Hotkey for it (Default Hotkey: V) so youâ€™re always ready to task your
          idle Villagers to get to work and not stand idle. Idle Villagers are
          useless Villagers!

          3. Spend your resources!
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Try and keep all of your resources spent at all times. The only time
          you should stop spending resources is for when you are saving up to
          advance to the next Age or to research an expensive upgrade. If you
          are starting to stockpile on a certain resrouce, don&apos;t hesitate
          to move your Villagers from one resource type to another!
