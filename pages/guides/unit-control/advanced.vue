          1. Split vs Splash Damage
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Against Units that have Splash (area-of-effect) Damage such as Siege
          Units or Fortresses, it is very important to make sure that your Units
          are not clumped up together in a small area.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Quickly select a group of your Units and move them away from the
          center of the Damage Area, then select another group and move them in
          another direction to minimize the Damage taken.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Similarly, when using Units that have Splash Damage, try and target
          groups of enemy Units to get the most out of your Splash Damage Unit.

        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Units that stand back in the army are generally high Damage but low
          Health units. This is particularly true for Bowman Type Units. \n
          \nSend your Anti-Ranged Units (such as your Cavalry) to move around
          the backline and flank them, quickly killing them and relieving a lot
          of pressure from your own front line.

        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Particularly useful in the early game where Unit counts are low and
          every single Unit counts.

        <p class="content">
          Pay attention to your Units&apos; Health Bars (located above them) and
          pull them back from the fight right before they die.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          If your opponent doesn&apos;t pay attention, their Units will start
          attacking your other Units, allowing you to get out of the fight with
          your injured Unit.
