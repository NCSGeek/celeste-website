          1. Find all of the same Type
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          When you need to select every Unit of the same Type (such as all of
          your Spearmen) you can simply hold Ctrl and then left-click on one of
          those units. It will highlight every Unit of that Type on your screen.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          This is very useful for situations such as when you want to move your
          Spearmen to defend against the flanking Cavalry of your opponent, or
          when you want to use your own Cavalry to flank the enemy backline.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Another way of selecting every Unit of the same Type is using the
          "Find all of the Selected Unit" Hotkey (inside the Find Unit Hotkeys
          section), but beware that this will select every Unit (or Building) of
          the same type in the match, regardless of where they are, unlike the
          Ctrl-Click method which only selects the ones on your screen.

          2. Easy Drag Military
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Enabling this option inside the "Camera and Chat" section of the
          Options menu will allow you to select only Military Units when
          dragging a box around them.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          This is particularly useful for moving your Military Units around
          without taking your Villagers off of the resource they were gathering.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          If you enable this option, you can hold Alt and then drag around your
          Units to include Villagers (and other non-Military Units, where
          applicable) in your selection.

        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Harassing your opponent&apos;s economy is pivotal in securing yourself
          an advantage and winning the match.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Send some of your faster Units to attack the enemy Villagers. Cavalry
          and faster Infantry Units are great choices for this.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          In return, you should have some of your own Units next to your
          Villagers in order to be prepared to defend against your
          opponent&apos;s raids.
