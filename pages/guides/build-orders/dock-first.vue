          This build is more advanced than the previous two, and should be used
          only on maps with Water available. Use it only once you&apos;re
          comfortable with the previous builds.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          In the Mountain Crossing map you can use your Dock as your first Wood
          Storehouse, placing it between to your Woodline and the lake behind
          you. You can build the dock with the fourth Villager, the initial
          three being on your closest Hunt.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Based on what resource you need the most, you can assign the Villager
          who built the Dock to either gather from the Fish next to your Dock,
          or the Woodline next to it.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          On other maps like Inland, Oasis or Treasure Island you can build a
          fast Dock after your Hunt and Wood storehouse. You send your initial 3
          Villagers to your Hunt, the fourth one to build a Storehouse on the
          Woodline.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          The next Villagers that train of your Town Center will go to your
          Woodline. Once you have 100 Wood you can start sending a Villager to
          the shoreline, so once it gets there you have around 150 wood to build
          your dock.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          Some civilizations (such as the Babylonians) have docks that cost 200
          wood, so send your Villager a bit later.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          Alternatively, you can build your dock off of one Storehouse, sending
          your fourth Villager to build the dock and gather Wood around your
          Hunt Storehouse or around your Town Center.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          Since Fishing Boats will provide you with a very high Food income, you
          can leave only 3 Villagers on your Hunt and send the rest of your
          Villagers to your Woodline. If your Dock gets attacked by your
          opponent, don&apos;t hesitate to use your Fishing Boats to repair it!
          They also have a Ranged Attack that can be used to buy time for you
          until you can train some Military Units of your own to defend against
          the incoming pressure.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          When using this build, pay attention to what your opponent is doing by
          Scouting them. If they are also going for a greedy strategy, you can
          start gathering Stone and make a Town Center in addition to your Dock,
          giving you lots of extra resources. But if your opponent is opting for
          a more aggressive strategy, be careful not to get overrun by the
          opponent&apos;s Military aggression before you have anything to defend
          with.
