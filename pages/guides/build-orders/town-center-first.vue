                As soon as you have 200 Food and 200 Wood you can age up. Take 2

                As soon as you age up you should have around 300 Wood and 300
                Stone and you can build your 2nd Town Center.

                Take your 5 Villagers off of your Stone Mine and build your 2nd
                Town Center.

              <li>
                While you are aging up, make sure to know where you are going to
                place it. It can be in a more defensive position, such as in
                range of your first Town Center, on your Woodline, Gold Mine or
                another resource. Alternatively if you know your opponent
                didn&apos;t make early Military Units you can build your 2nd
                Town Center a bit further away to secure some resources outside
                of your main base.

          This build will need small variations if you play the Babylonians, due
          to the need to make extra Ox Carts but the timings are roughly the
          same and you can adjust your build with a little practice. Practice
          makes perfect!
