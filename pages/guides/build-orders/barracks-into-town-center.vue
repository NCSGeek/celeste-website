          The goal of this build is to have some Age I Military Units early on
          to either put some pressure or defend against the opponent&apos;s
          pressure.

                increase your Food income so you can afford making Villagers and

                If you use this opening to be aggressive you can use your units
                to harass your opponent’s Hunt or Woodline. When harassing their
                Woodline keep constant attention to your Units so they don’t get
                hit by too many shots from your opponent&apos;s Town Center.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once you can sustain Villager and Military production, build a
                Storehouse next to your Stone Mine and start gathering Stone so
                you can build your second Town Center when you reach Age II.
