          The goal of this build is to have some Age I Military Units early on
          to either put some pressure or defend against the opponent&apos;s
          pressure.
        </p>
        <ul class="content ul">
          <li>Start by sending your first 3 Villagers to your Hunt.</li>
          <li>
            The next Villagers that are trained from your Town Center will go to
            the small Tree patches around the Town Center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have 200 Wood you can start building your Barracks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gather 50 more Wood so you can afford a Storehouse next to your
            Woodline.
          </li>
          <li>
            The next Villagers from your Town Center will go to the Hunt to
            increase your Food income so you can afford making Villagers and
            Military Units.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you use this opening to be aggressive you can use your units to
            harass your opponent’s Hunt or Woodline. When harassing their
            Woodline keep constant attention to your Units so they don’t get hit
            by too many shots from your opponent&apos;s Town Center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you can sustain Villager and Military production, build a
            Storehouse next to your Stone Mine and start gathering Stone so you
            can build your second Town Center when you reach Age II.
          </li>
        </ul>
