          1. Gold and Stone Storehouses
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          When building a Storehouse next to Gold and Stone deposits, make sure
          to leave a gap between them and the Storehouse so your Villagers can
          fit in and have efficient gathering. Taking that one extra second to
          carefully place your Storehouse can been a huge difference in your
          income in the long run!

        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Once you reach your maximum population capacity, you will be unable to
          queue up any additional Units. This can be devastating especially in
          the early game. One easy way of not getting House blocked is having 1
          Villager constantly building one House after another.

          3. Villager Distribution
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          It is important to have a balanced economy. Pay attention to what army
          composition you are going for and then distribute your Villagers based
          on that.
        </p>
        <ul class="content ul">
          <li>
            Going for an Infantry-heavy army? You will need more Villagers on
            Food than you normally would.
          </li>
          <li>Going for mainly Ranged Units? Send more Villagers to Wood.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content">
          You can see the number of Villagers on each resource on the bottom
          right corner of each resource&apos;s icon in the resource bar at the
          top of the screen (As shown in the picture). You can also click on
          those icons to move your camera to a group of that resource&apos;s
          gatherers.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          A sign of a good player is to know when to change their Villager
          distribution to match their Unit composition&apos;s required
          resources. Don&apos;t be afraid to move Villagers around!
